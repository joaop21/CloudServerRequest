# CloudServerRequest
Distributed Systems project in Java.

This project was carried out in the first semester of the third year of computer engineering at University of Minho. [2018-2019]

The main purpose of the project was to program a server that would provide servers for rental, and consequently 
a client that could rent and use these servers.

This project was developed by me and my colleagues, respectively:
